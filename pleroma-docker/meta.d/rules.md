## Rules

### We allow:

In short: Everything that's not outright bullying and/or illegal.

This is not a safe-space, but it's not an unmoderated wasteland either.

Act like an adult and think before you type.

### We don't allow:

- **Any content that's illegal in the United States****
- **Unflagged NSFW/NSFL Content**
- Gore and/or animal cruelty
- Targeted bullying/spamming
- Threatening or bullying someone for their opinion. (Just block/mute them.)
- Being a dick. (You know what that means.)
- Bot accounts, unless you have a written permission
- **Boosting stuff that's against our rules. (You'll be responsible for the boosted content.)**
