## Rules

### We allow:

In short: Everything that's not outright bullying and/or illegal.

We will take an approach of minimal moderation. Political disagreements and content disputes are not causes for banning, but blatant harassment, inciting violence, etc. are.

Act like an adult and think before you type.

### We don't allow:

- **Any content that's illegal in the United States****
- **Unflagged NSFW/NSFL Content**
- Targeted bullying/spamming/threatening
- Being a dick (you know what that means, don't pretend that this is some vague, impossible-to-understand rule)
- Bot accounts, unless you have been given explicit permission
- **Boosting stuff that's against our rules (you'll be responsible for the boosted content)**
