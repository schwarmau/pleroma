## Stability / Uptime

We're running the pleroma `develop` branch.
Bugs and downtimes are an expected part of normal operation.
Also there's scheduled downtime (about 1-2h) every friday at 10PM CET/CEST for updates/maintenance.
Occasionally there may be unannounced downtimes for emergency patches, but that usually happens late at night (CET/CEST).

However, despite all that our uptime is usually [>=99.0%](https://uptime.is/99)

## Warrant Canary

cofe.rocks declares that, up to this point, no warrants have been served,
